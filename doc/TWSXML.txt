Introduction
============

TWSXML is an ad-hoc xml standard that facilitates easy translation from
and to IB's TWS API.  While it is generally desirable to have a formal
specification TWSXML is too tightly coupled with IB's API and hence any
effort to formally specify TWSXML without direct access to the
underlying API would cause severe maintenance pressure.

For people that are acquainted with the C++ or Java API there should be
no major surprises.  There is a direct one-to-one correspondance between
class members and TWSXML attributes.  The only difference therefore lies
in the bracketing tag names which are briefly described below.

Bracket tags
============

TWSXML
------
This is always the root node and only the root node.  The name space
http://www.ga-group.nl/twsxml-0.1.  This has no direct correspondance to
anything in the API.  Any such document

    <TWSXML xmlns="http://www.ga-group.nl/twsxml-0.1">
      ...
    </TWSXML>

will be understood by twsdo.

request
-------
Next down is the request.  A TWSXML document can contain a sequence of
requests.  The only allowed and obligatory attribute is type.

Its only children are query and response, see below.

At the moment we allow:

  - type="contract_details"     represents the full shebang of contract
                                information as known to IB
  - type="historical_data"      represents an excerpt of historical data
  - type="market_data"          represents a live-feed of market data
  - type="place_order"          represents orders

It is common that a user will send a request with only the query child
to twsdo, and in return twsdo will hand out a request where the query
part is repeated and a response child contains the actual response from
the TWS.

query
-----
This is the query part of a request, so to speak the actual request.

The child node(s) of the query depend on the request type, see above.

response
--------
This is most likely filled in by twsdo with the result the TWS has given
at the point in time when the query was executed.

The child nodes of the response depend on the request type, see above.
Here's a brief summary of what you might encounter:

  + type="historical_data"
    - sequence of "row"

  + type="contract_details"
    - sequence of "ContractDetails" 

  + type="place_order"
    - one "OpenOrder"
    - sequence of "OrderStatus"

or the (experimental) TWSXML.xsd.
